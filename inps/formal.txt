i mean that you have to really be her friend .
are you posing a rhetorical question ?
men pretend to love in order to have intercourse ; women pretend to enjoy intercourse in order to get love .
i do not intend to be mean .
i would estimate an average of __NUM % initially but then , once you become acquainted with the person , perhaps __NUM % .
because some women send subtle messages to men rather than being clear .
let us purchase coffee and converse and proceed from that point !
also , i dislike it when my father is unhappy .
ask him if you should go see a doctor .
you can post more questioins on yahoo ! answers .
he probably has many things to worry about right now other than you .
but i do not believe that he will be unfaithful or leave you due to lack of intercourse .
will i always feel that way ?
however , he may enjoy all of the waiting , dreaming and flirting .
also , i would like to try again .
some men shave , it depends on the woman .
well , if you are really attracted to this guy , then smile and speak nicely to him .
i am not certain whether he loves you , but he definitely likes you .
i would invite you on a date but i live in oregon and i am entirely uniformed as to where you live .
women are coomplicated .
